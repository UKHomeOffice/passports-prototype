  <h1>What you need to do</h1>

  <p>You need to ask someone to confirm your identity. They can do this online. They don't need to sign a printed photo.</p>

  <h2>You need to ask someone who:</h2>

  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>has known you personally for at least 2 years, for example as a friend <br>or neighbour</li>
    <li>works in or is retired from a <a href="/govuk/" target="_blank">recognised profession</a></li>
    <li>has a current UK passport</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>You must contact the person</h2>
  <p>We'll send them an email with your application details and a link to go online. You must contact them before we send the email.</p>

<div class="panel panel-border-wide">
  <p>Make sure the person knows your date of birth, including the year.</p>
</div>
