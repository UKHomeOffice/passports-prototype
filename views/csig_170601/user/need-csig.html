          <p>Your passport application is on hold. You look very different in your old and new photos.</p>

    <h2>What you need to do</h2>

    <p>You need to ask somebody to confirm your identity. This is similar to a countersignature but you can do it online. We'll send them an email with the details.</p>

    <p>Check who can confirm your identity and <a href="give-csig-details">tell us who'll do this for you.</a>
