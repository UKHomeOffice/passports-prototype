    <p>We sometimes need to check that the person applying for a new passport is who they claim to be. </p>

      <h2>To confirm someone's identity, you must:</h2>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>have known them for at least 2 years</li>
          <li>be able to identify them, for example theyâ€™re a friend, neighbour or colleague (not just someone you know professionally, like a doctor)</li>
          <li>be a person of good standing in your community or work in (or be retired from) a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications/accepted-occupations-for-countersignatories" target="_blank">recognised profession</a></li>
          <li>live in the UK</li>
          <li>have a current UK passport</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>You must not be:</h2>
          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>related by birth or marriage</li>
            <li>be in a relationship with them or live at the same address</li>
          </ul>
