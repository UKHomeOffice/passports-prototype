    <h2>What you need to do</h2>

    <p>You need to ask someone to confirm your identity. This is like a countersignature but they can do it online. They must:

      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>have a current UK passport</li>
        <li>work in or be retired from a <a href="/govuk/recognised-professions/" target="_blank">recognised profession</a></li>
        <li>have known you as a friend, neighbour or colleague for at<br>least 2 years</li>
      </ul>

<h2>What you'll need</h2>
      <p>You'll need this person's:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>UK passport number</li>
          <li>full name (as written on their passport)</a></li>
          <li>phone number and email address</li>
        </ul>

<p>We'll send them an email with a link to confirm your identity online.</p>
<p><a href="/csig_170810/user/give-csig-details" class="button">Tell us who'll do this for you</a></p>

<div class="panel-important">
  <p>We need to confirm your identity before 14 August 2017 or youâ€™ll need to start a new application.</p>
