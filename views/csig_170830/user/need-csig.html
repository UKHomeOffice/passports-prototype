  <h1>Ask someone to confirm <br>your identity</h1>
  <p>Your passport application is on hold. You look very different in your old and new photos.</p>

You need to ask someone you know well to confirm your identity. They can do this online. They don't need to sign a printed photo.</p>

<h2>Who can do this</h2>
<p>You need to ask someone who:</p>

  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>has known you as a friend, neighbour or colleague for at<br>least 2 years</li>
    <li>work in or be retired from a <a href="/govuk/" target="_blank">recognised profession</a></li>
    <li>have a current UK passport</li>
  </ul>
<h2>What you need to do</h2>
  <ol class="list-number">

    <li>have known you as a friend, neighbour or colleague for at<br>least 2 years</li>
  </ul>

<h2>What you'll need</h2>
  <p>You'll need this person's:</p>

    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>UK passport number</li>
      <li>full name (as written on their passport)</a></li>
      <li>phone number and email address</li>
    </ul>

<p>We'll send them an email with a link to confirm your identity online.</p>
<p><a href="/csig_170830/user/give-csig-details" class="button">Tell us who'll do this for you</a></p>



<div class="panel-important">
  <p>We need to confirm your identity before 14 August 2017 or you’ll need to start a new application.</p>
