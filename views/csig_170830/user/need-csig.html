    <li>have known you as a friend, neighbour or colleague for at<br>least 2 years</li>
  </ul>

<h2>What you'll need</h2>
  <p>You'll need this person's:</p>

    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>UK passport number</li>
      <li>full name (as written on their passport)</a></li>
      <li>phone number and email address</li>
    </ul>

<p>We'll send them an email with a link to confirm your identity online.</p>
<p><a href="/csig_170830/user/give-csig-details" class="button">Tell us who'll do this for you</a></p>



<div class="panel-important">
  <p>We need to confirm your identity before 14 August 2017 or youâ€™ll need to start a new application.</p>
